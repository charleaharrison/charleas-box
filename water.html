        <h5>Source 1: <em>The World's Water Crisis</em>, 'Explained', Netflix 2019</h5>
        <h6>Water sources</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Of the earth's water, 97% is salt water, 2% is frozen freshwater (trapped in the poles), and 1% is freshwater available to humankind (with most of that 1% found underground, where it is expensive to extract)</li>
          <li>Kuwait is one of the poorest countries in terms of water supply, with just 10m cubed per capita, whilst Canada is one of the richest at 100,000m cubed per capita</li>
          <li>In Mexico City, water is being pumped from underground aquifers, which are water stores accumulated over millenia. They have taken 50% of the water from their local acquifer, which has also caused soil to compress, meaning parts of the city are literally sinking; in some places by 9inches per year.</li>
          <li>This century, our water consumption has increased sevenfold, and water sources are becoming much more unreliable due to the climate crisis</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Water use</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Most humans use: one gallon of water per day on handwashing and hygiene, one gallon for drinking, and three gallons for every toilet flush, but this only accounts for 8% of our freshwater use each year</li>
          <li>Of the remaining 92%, 70% of freshwater use goes into agriculture, and 22% into industry</li>
          <li>Industry example: in a bottle of Coke, 98% of the water in the bottle isn't in the final liquid; it is embedded inside the many ingredients that have gone into making that product</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Some context: Water contents in everyday items</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>One glass of beer: 74 litres</li>
          <li>One cup of coffee: 130 litres</li>
          <li>One cotton t-shirt: 2,500 litres</li>
          <li>Cheese: 5,060 litres per kilogram</li>
          <li>Hamburger: 15,000 litres per kilogram</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Fact: there isn't enough water in the world for everyone to follow America's high-meat diet</h4>
        <br>
        <h6>Water and capitalism</h6>
        <p>Farmers pay very little for water, meaning the true value of water is not included in the price of the burger, explaining why fast-food outlets are able to sell such cheap meat-based items. However, it's predicted that water will become 'the petroleum for the next century', private interests have already started buying up water.</p>
        <h6>What are the solutions?</h6>
        <p>The filtering of saltwater into freshwater, or desalination, is an increasing practice, however it is miniscule in proportion to the amount of water we use. The volume of water successfully desalinated in 2017 amounted to under 1% of the total water consumed. This is also an extremely expensive process and requires large amounts of energy. A dramatic increase in this practice would mean that consumer goods would sky-rocket, as their biggest ingredient would be attributed mass capital value.</p>
        <p>The biggest issue in water gaining value is that it would primarily impact the poor. If we started investing more value into water by investing more in water maintenance and distribution infrastructures, then water would become an luxury to lower income groups. In 2017, Philadelphia started experimenting with tying water prices to income. This is one idea that could protect those in poverty whilst attributing value to water to protect its infrastructure.</p>
        <h6>Day Zero</h6>
        <p>Cape Town scheduled a "day zero" for March 2018; the day in which taps would be switched off and residents would have to queue for rations of water as a result of critically low supply levels. This warning triggered a mass change in water consumption, and residents started taking drastic action to reduce and manage their water intake. As Day Zero then kept getting pushed back, by the end of 2018, Cape Town's water consumption per day had reduced to under half of that which it had been four years earlier. The Day Zero clock was then paused indefinitely.</p>

          <h5><a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/" target="_blank">UN Water Facts</a></h5>
          <p>This page by the UN provides incredible insight into the global impact of water sources, use, and waste. Particularly interesting is the section on gender and water, in which they highlight how lack of freshwater supply for less developed nations disproportionality affects women as they are more often tasked with the duty of collecting water, and also require more water for sanitation during mestruation and childbirth.</p>

          <p>National Geographic provide very interesting statistics on the water use in household appliances, daily activities, travel, diet, and industry.</p>
