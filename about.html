        <h3>Why am I here?</h3>
        <p>My name is Charlea, and I'm a forgetful human. I care about a lot of things, including environmentalism and social issues. Whilst I feel very passionately about these issues, my memory is like a seive and I struggle to retain vital stats and figures to support my values. Ever been in a debate where you wish you could remember that statistic from that article you read that time? That's me, and that's why I'm here.</p>
        <p>Each post will focus on a specific topic, and will act as an information sheet containing statistics and resources on that issue. Rather than an article or blog, these will be pockets of information, cutting the opinion (as much as I humanly can) and heading straight for the facts. You can navigate from the homepage to see different themes of posts.</p>
